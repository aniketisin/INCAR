1. Keep the following files in the same directory as the pdb file for which you want to find the stacked bases,

code1.py
code2.py
code3.py
param
run_stacking.sh

2. To set permissions for run_stacking.sh to be an executable, run the command,

chmod 777 run_stacking.sh

3. To find the stacked bases,
./run_stacking.sh <PDB id>

For example, if the PDB of interest is 1KXK.pdb,
./run_stacking.sh 1KXK

4. The files generated are, 
<PDB id>_stacked_bases : displays all stacked pairs in list fom
<PDB id>_nomenclature : displays all stacked pairs differentiated into the distant and consecutive stacking with the correct stacking nomenclature conventions.
